# PDF as a file system

Yeah. WIP.

There is nothing to look at yet.  You can build it and run things like
`./6.out my.pdf Root Pages Kids 0 Kids 0 Kids 0 Contents .` to dump a
specific object (text, images, fonts, etc).

This is Sigrid's project, but I wanted to study the source code and try to make some progress myself.
